    <h3>About visual studio</h3>
    <p>Visual Studio is a powerful developer tool that you can use to complete the entire development cycle in one place. It is a comprehensive integrated development environment (IDE) that you can use to write, edit, debug, and build code, and then deploy your app. Beyond code editing and debugging, Visual Studio includes compilers, code completion tools, source control, extensions, and many more features to enhance every stage of the software development process.</p>
    <h3>About console screen</h3>
    <p>Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows. An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode (so as to occupy the entire screen). The user can switch between the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key combination. The text mode is unavailable in Windows Vista and later. Starting with Windows 10, however, a native full-screen mode is available.

        Windows Console instances are typically used for apps that do not need to display images but might use color. Examples include cmd.exe, Windows PowerShell, Far Manager, and Midnight Commander.
        
        In 2019, the Windows Console infrastructure was open-sourced under the MIT License, alongside Windows Terminal</p></center>
